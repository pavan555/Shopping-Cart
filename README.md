We're going to setup a ecommerce application in which

Products -> Cart -> Order
for Customer
and also optionally products have tags


One cart may contain multiple cartItems -> but one cartItem belongs to only particular cart -> 
one cartItem can contain only one product but one product can appear in multiple cartItems

Cart -> CartItems -> Product 

One Order may contain multiple orderItems -> but one orderItem belongs to only one product 
Order -> OrderItems -> Product
one orderItem can contain only one product but one product can appear in multiple orderItems.
